BranchDecoder is a recursive, broadly searching, string encoding detection, 
and decoding tool. It attempts to walk through every potential string 
encoding and assembles an EncodingTree of matched encodings and optionally 
their intermediate values.

**This is in early active development, and not a complete project.**

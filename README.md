# BranchDecoder

BranchDecoder is a recursive, broadly searching, string encoding detection, 
and decoding tool. It attempts to walk through every potential string 
encoding and assembles an EncodingTree of matched encodings and optionally 
their intermediate values.

This is in active development, and not a complete project.
